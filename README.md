# Nachtschicht21 (GLAMHACK2021) 
- Interactive Virtual Reality 3d Exhibition  

## Goal
- , one , two or three camara movements, and lay the cornerstone for the artworks to be placed into the VR exhibition room

## Project Description 
The initial concept was to transform the content from the website [Nachtsicht21](https://www.nachtschicht21.ch/) into a more immersive experience with the use of Virtual reality visualisation means. 

After some discussion, the team decided to bring the user in a space framework and to dispose paintings in this colourfull environment such as if they were forming a new constellation. 

In addition, some animation were associated to each painting to allow the visitor to better appreciate the images on the the panels. 

## Screenshots
Here are some screenshots from the designing process of the VR environment:
